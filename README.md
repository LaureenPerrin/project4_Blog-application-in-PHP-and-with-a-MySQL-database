# project4_Blog-application-in-PHP-and-with-a-MySQL-database
Specifications : You will develop a simple blog application in PHP and with a MySQL database. It must provide a frontend interface (ticket reading) and a backend interface (ticket administration for writing). We must find all the elements of a CRUD:  Create: creating tickets Read: reading tickets Update: ticket update Delete: deleting tickets Each ticket must allow the addition of comments, which can be moderated in the administration interface if necessary. Readers should be able to "post" comments so that they can be easily traced back into the admin interface for moderation.  The administration interface will be protected by password. The writing of tickets will be in a WYSIWYG interface based on TinyMCE, so that Jean does not need to write his story in HTML (we understand that he does not really want!).  You will develop in PHP without using a framework to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of programming. The code will be built on an MVC architecture. You will develop as much as possible in object-oriented (at least, the model must be constructed as an object).
